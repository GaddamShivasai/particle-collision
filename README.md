# particle-collision

This project is for the course "Numerische Modellierung von Mehrphasenströmungen" offered by 
Department of Fluid Mechanics (Institute für Strömungsmechanik) at TU Dresden. 

The collision is modelled using Soft-Sphere approach a.k.a Discrete Element Method. The `Cell-Lists` are used to prune the particles 
before checking for the collision criterion. The contact law is non-linear.
